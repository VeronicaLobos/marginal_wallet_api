# This file defines the outputs from our global resources, such as the ARNs
# of the IAM roles we create. These outputs can then be used by our
# environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod).

# We will add outputs here once we apply the IAM resources.
# Example:
# output "ecs_task_execution_role_arn" {
#   description = "The ARN of the ECS task execution role."
#   value       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn
# }
